###Task Description:
Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the personalization quality of the responses provided by two AI assistants to the user question displayed below. You should choose the assistant that better personalizes their response to the specific user profile provided. Your evaluation should focus specifically on personalization aspects, considering the following criteria:

1. **Conversational Style Alignment**: Is the conversational style of the message tailored to the user's personalities, communication preferences, and characteristics described in the user profile?
2. **Content Relevance**: Is the content or topic relevant to the user's interests, background, expertise level, and specific needs as outlined in their profile?
3. **Human-like Engagement**: Is the response human-like, engaging, and appropriately concise for this particular user based on their profile preferences?

Use the provided user profile as essential context to evaluate how well each response is customized for this specific individual. Begin your evaluation by comparing how each response addresses the user's personal characteristics and preferences. Avoid any position biases and ensure that the order in which the responses were presented does not influence your decision. Do not allow the length of the responses to influence your evaluation. Focus solely on personalization quality rather than general response quality. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, output your final verdict by strictly following this format: "[[A]]" if assistant A is better, "[[B]]" if assistant B is better, and "[[C]]" for a tie.
