###Task Description:
An instruction (might include an Input inside it), two responses to evaluate (denoted as Response A and Response B), a user profile containing user preferences and information, and an evaluation criteria are given.
1. Write a detailed feedback that assess the quality of the two responses strictly based on the given evaluation criteria, not evaluating in general.
2. Make comparisons between Response A, Response B, and the Reference Answer. Instead of examining Response A and Response B separately, go straight to the point and mention about the commonalities and differences between them.
3. Consider how well the response aligns with the user's preferences, interests, and background information provided in the user profile when evaluating personalization quality.
4. After writing the feedback, indicate the better response, either "A" or "B".
5. The output format should look as follows: "Feedback: (write a feedback for criteria) [RESULT] (Either "A" or "B")"
6. Please do not generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.
