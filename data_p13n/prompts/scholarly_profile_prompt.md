# Instruction

Generate a targeted academic writing user profile for **research paper title generation** based on the provided academic writing and research history data. This profile will be used to predict what style of titles this user would create for research papers based on abstracts. 

**IMPORTANT: You must analyze HOW this user writes titles, NOT list WHAT topics they research. Do not output lists of keywords, research topics, or technical terms. Focus only on writing style patterns and behavioral tendencies.**

Focus on understanding title creation patterns:

1. **Academic Title Writing Style and Structure Preferences:**
   - Preferred title length and complexity patterns (e.g., "prefers concise 6-8 word titles" or "favors longer descriptive titles with multiple clauses")
   - Use of descriptive vs. concise title formulations (e.g., "tends toward descriptive titles that explain methodology" or "prefers concise titles that state main findings")
   - Balance between technical precision and accessibility (e.g., "maintains technical accuracy while keeping titles accessible" or "prioritizes technical precision over readability")
   - Consistent terminology and academic language choices in titles (e.g., "consistently uses formal academic language" or "incorporates domain-specific jargon")

2. **Research Content Emphasis and Title Focus:**
   - Emphasis on methodology vs. results vs. application in title creation (e.g., "titles typically highlight novel methodologies" or "focuses on practical applications in titles")
   - Handling of broad research contributions vs. specific findings in titles (e.g., "titles emphasize specific technical findings" or "prefers broader contribution statements")
   - Approach to capturing interdisciplinary vs. specialized research in titles (e.g., "adapts title style for interdisciplinary audiences" or "uses highly specialized terminology")
   - Use of domain-specific terminology vs. general academic language (e.g., "balances technical terms with accessible language" or "relies heavily on field-specific terminology")

3. **Title Generation Behavioral Patterns:**
   - Systematic vs. creative approach to title formulation (e.g., "follows consistent title structure patterns" or "employs creative phrasing and wordplay")
   - Adaptation of title style for different research areas and publication venues (e.g., "adjusts title complexity based on target audience" or "maintains consistent style across all domains")
   - Incorporation of current research trends and terminology in titles (e.g., "integrates contemporary buzzwords effectively" or "prefers established terminology over trendy terms")
   - Consistency in title quality and informativeness across different abstract types (e.g., "maintains high title quality regardless of research type" or "title quality varies with research complexity")

**Remember: Analyze the user's title writing BEHAVIOR and STYLE, not their research topics. Output should describe patterns like "prefers X style" or "tends to write Y type of titles", not lists of research keywords.**

# Output Format

Output the scholarly user profile strictly in plain text describing the user's title creation patterns and writing style tendencies. Focus specifically on patterns that predict **what style of titles this user would generate for research papers** based on their academic writing patterns and research communication preferences. 

**Do NOT output:**
- Lists of research topics or keywords
- Technical terminology from their research
- Subject matter content
- Research domains or fields

**DO output:**
- Writing style patterns and preferences
- Title structure tendencies  
- Language choice patterns
- Behavioral patterns in title creation

Derive insights strictly from the provided academic writing and research interaction data. Do not include explanations, introductions, headings, bullet points, or any formatting structure.
