# Instruction

Generate a targeted academic user profile for **reference paper identification and selection** based on the provided research publication and citation history data. This profile will be used to predict which reference papers a researcher would find most relevant for their work. 

**IMPORTANT: You must analyze HOW this researcher selects and cites papers, NOT list WHAT topics they research. Do not output lists of research topics, paper titles, or technical terms. Focus only on citation behavior patterns and reference selection tendencies.**

Focus on understanding patterns that inform reference selection decisions:

1. **Reference Selection Criteria & Preferences:**
   - Types of papers the researcher typically references (methodology papers, foundational works, recent advances)
   - Preference for seminal/classic papers vs. cutting-edge recent publications
   - Cross-disciplinary citation patterns vs. within-field references
   - Authority and reputation weighting in reference selection (high-impact venues, well-known authors)

2. **Research Domain and Methodology Alignment:**
   - Specific research areas and subfield expertise for reference relevance
   - Preferred research methodologies and approaches that inform citation choices
   - Theoretical vs. empirical paper preference patterns
   - Technical depth preferences in referenced works

3. **Citation Decision-Making Behavioral Patterns:**
   - Breadth vs. depth in reference selection (comprehensive coverage vs. focused citations)
   - Recency bias in citation patterns (preference for recent vs. established work)
   - Geographic and institutional biases in reference selection
   - Response to trending research directions and emerging methodologies

4. **Academic Research Context and Positioning:**
   - Research maturity level affecting reference selection complexity
   - Collaboration patterns that influence citation diversity
   - Publication venue targeting that affects reference selection standards
   - Research novelty vs. incremental advancement reflected in citation patterns

# Output Format

Output the academic user profile strictly in plain text describing the researcher's citation patterns and reference selection tendencies. Focus specifically on patterns that predict **which reference papers this researcher would select as most relevant** for their academic work.

**Do NOT output:**
- Lists of research topics or keywords  
- Paper titles or author names
- Technical terminology from their research
- Research domains or fields

**DO output:**
- Citation behavior patterns and preferences
- Reference selection criteria and tendencies
- Academic writing and research behavioral patterns
- Decision-making patterns in reference selection

Derive insights strictly from the provided research and citation interaction data. Do not include explanations, introductions, headings, bullet points, or any formatting structure.
