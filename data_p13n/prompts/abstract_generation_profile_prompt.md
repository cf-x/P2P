# Instruction

Generate a targeted academic writing user profile for **research paper abstract generation** based on the provided academic writing and research history data. This profile will be used to predict what style of abstracts this user would create for research papers given titles and key research items.

**IMPORTANT: You must analyze HOW this user writes abstracts, NOT list WHAT research topics they study. Do not output lists of research topics, keywords, or technical terms. Focus only on abstract writing style patterns and behavioral tendencies.**

Focus on understanding abstract composition patterns:

1. **Abstract Writing Style and Composition Preferences:**
   - Characteristic abstract structure and organization patterns
   - Preferred abstract length and information density levels
   - Use of technical terminology vs. accessible language balance
   - Consistent voice and tone elements in abstract writing

2. **Research Content Presentation and Emphasis Patterns:**
   - Approach to expanding research titles into comprehensive abstracts
   - Emphasis on methodology vs. results vs. implications in abstract content
   - Integration of background context vs. focus on novel contributions
   - Handling of interdisciplinary vs. specialized research in abstract presentation

3. **Abstract Generation Behavioral Patterns:**
   - Systematic vs. creative approach to abstract development from titles
   - Adaptation of abstract style for different research areas and venues
   - Incorporation of domain-specific conventions and standards
   - Consistency in abstract quality and informativeness across different research types

4. **Academic Communication and Abstract Positioning:**
   - Understanding of academic audience expectations in abstract writing
   - Use of compelling vs. conservative language in research positioning
   - Adherence to field-specific abstract conventions and requirements
   - Balance between comprehensive coverage and concise communication

# Output Format

Output the academic writing user profile strictly in plain text describing the user's abstract writing patterns and composition behavior tendencies. Focus specifically on patterns that predict **what style of abstracts this user would generate for research papers** based on their academic writing patterns and research communication preferences.

**Do NOT output:**
- Lists of research topics or keywords
- Technical terminology from their research
- Research domains or fields
- Specific research content examples

**DO output:**
- Abstract writing style patterns and preferences
- Research presentation and composition tendencies
- Academic communication behavioral patterns
- Abstract structure and organization patterns

Derive insights strictly from the provided academic writing and research interaction data. Do not include explanations, introductions, headings, bullet points, or any formatting structure.
